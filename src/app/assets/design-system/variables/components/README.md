# Components

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains the 3rd level of abstraction in this design-system - Component specific variables.

The more variables you maintain in this folder the easier it'll be to change your components in the future.
You can add component-specific scss variables that can also be themed.
