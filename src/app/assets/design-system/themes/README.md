# Themes

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains all your themes or white-labels.
Make sure that all themes have the same variables included and that the theme is imported in `./src/assets/global.scss`.

A theme is the 2nd level of abstraction in this design system
by turning the loosely defined Colors, Spacings and Typography into design-system-tokens.

These tokens should be used as often as possible to provide an easy update path in case you need to change
then CI or to increase the "themabilty".
